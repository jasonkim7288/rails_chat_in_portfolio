            <p>My first Ruby project was Gmail terminal app. I felt like I could do anyting if I use gems. Allmost
                everything that I want to implement was already made by gems which was awesome.</p>

            <p>Users can access their Gmail accounts and check the email without any browser and even send a simple
                email with a file attached. It will be a good idea to use this Gmail application if you are a
                computer server manager which has only command line UNIX environment or if your browser has been
                infected by any serious virus so you cannot use it. Once a simple security setting is changed, it is
                free to access Gmail anytime on command prompt.
